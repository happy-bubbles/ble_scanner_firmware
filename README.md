# Ble Scanner Firmware

ALPHA PROJECT NOT IN USE

## Overview

This project contains the next generation firmware for the Bluetooth module in the presence detector. It includes a secure bootloader and DFU functionality for over-the-air updates over BLE. 
I am including the private key for signing firmwares to ensure this remains open source and someone can make their own to use over the air if they want. Oherwise all the detector boards provide a Tag-Connect compatible programming header that can be used to flash the BLE module over SWD.
